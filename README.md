## Probing the phonetic and phonological knowledge of tones in Mandarin TTS models

### Update
Thanks for those who have pointed out bugs in this repo. I was surprised to find that many of you were interested in this project. I am sorry that detailed steps for training the model were not provided and that some common bugs were not fixed. I have fixed a bug in this repo. Another common problem about replication is that training the model from scratch is very hard. So before training I initialized the model with the weights from a pre-trained English model ([link]((https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2)). With the pre-trained English model initialization, the Chinese model converged very fast and was able to produce natural speech. 
I will try to update detailed training steps soon. 


### Data

Audio samples can be found here: [online demo](https://lingjzhu.github.io/TTS_and_Tone_demo/)

All synthesized stimuli can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AX0jqPnigC2s2CSuDbWhNwVRwcFg8dmM?usp=sharing).

Traning data can be found [here](https://www.data-baker.com/open_source.html).

### Demo
#### Online Colab demo.  
You can directly run the TTS models (Tacotron2 and WaveGlow) on Google Colab (with a powerful GPU).  
  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lingjzhu/probing-TTS-models/blob/master/TTS_colab_demo.ipynb)  
  
#### Runing locally.  
torch == 1.1.0
1. Download pre-trained Mandarin models at this [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Sf9t4IzMVGAgcznoTIn2mRNlcVkZuE3w?usp=sharing).
2. Download [pre-trained Chinese BERT](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-BERT-wwm) (`BERT-wwm-ext, Chinese`).
3. Run ``inference_bert.ipynb''   
Or:  
   Use the following command line.  
```
python synthesize.py --text ./stimuli/tone3_stimuli --use_bert --bert_folder path_to_bert_folder 
--tacotron_path path_to_pre-trained_tacotron2 --waveglow_path path_to_pre-trained_waveglow 
--out_dir path_output_dir
```

Note. The current implementation is based on the Nvidia's public implementation of Tacotron2 and Waveglow

### Training steps
1. Download the dataset;
2. Run scripts in the preprocessing folder;
3. Run the training script (detailed descriptions of each argument can be found in the source code).
